# 📅 Day 9 — June 9, 2025

## 🧠 Reflection & Reset

After 8 straight days of focused backend development — setting up authentication, refining API structures, and polishing error handling — I’m intentionally taking a day off to rest and reset. ☕️

## ✅ What's Done
- Wrapped up all core backend functionality yesterday.
- Final README and response structure completed.
- Linked project with its dedicated devlog repo.

## 🔭 What's Next
- Begin frontend development using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Build responsive UI for login, dashboard, and history.
- Integrate with backend APIs for seamless experience.

## 💬 Thought of the Day
> “Even rest is part of the grind — clarity today fuels productivity tomorrow.”
