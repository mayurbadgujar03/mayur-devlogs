### 📍 Day 12 — June 13, 2025

#### 🔗 Frontend-Backend Integration: Static Routing

- Connected all **navigation buttons** (`<a>` tags) to respective frontend routes.
- Served all static frontend files via **Express.js**:
  - `index.html` set as the default base route.
  - Routes like `/dashboard`, `/history`, `/profile` now properly display respective pages.
- Ensured consistent page switching via links without full reloads.

#### 🧼 Layout Consistency

- Refactored the **dashboard header layout** for consistency:
  - Matched design with the history page.
  - Unified padding, flexbox layout, and button alignment.
  - Improved responsive behavior (stacked layout for mobile).

✅ Backend and frontend now speaking the same design language.
