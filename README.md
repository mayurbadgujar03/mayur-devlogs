# 🛠️ Devlogs – My Journey as a Developer

Welcome to my **developer journal**, where I document the entire process of building real-world projects — from scratch to deployment. This repo tracks my technical decisions, learnings, bugs, fixes, and wins.

> 🚀 Why?  
> To reflect, stay consistent, and show how I build in public.
