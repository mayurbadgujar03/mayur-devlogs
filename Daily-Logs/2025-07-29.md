# Dev Log: Tuesday, July 29, 2025

## Summary

Today's focus was on establishing a robust and scalable foundation for the **MaxTeam** project. I implemented a centralized system for handling API responses and errors, set up secure environment configuration, and defined the core data schemas for users and tasks. I also dedicated time to industry research by reading about current FinTech trends and began preliminary research into TypeScript.

## Key Activities & Accomplishments ‚ú®

### 1. Backend Infrastructure & API Health

* **Standardized Responses:** Created reusable `ApiResponse` and `ApiError` classes to ensure consistent, predictable HTTP responses across the entire API, which simplifies frontend integration and debugging.
* **Secure Configuration:** Added a `.env.example` file to document necessary environment variables, improving security and simplifying setup for new developers.
* **Health Check Endpoint:** Implemented a `/healthcheck` route to provide a simple, effective way to monitor application status.

### 2. Core Schema Definition

* Laid the data foundation for the application by defining the Mongoose schemas for:
    * `User`
    * `Task`
    * `SubTask`

### 3. Research & Learning

* Read an industry report on **2025 FinTech Trends** from Plaid to stay current with market direction and new technologies.
* Conducted an initial exploration of **TypeScript** to evaluate its benefits for this project.

## Plan for Tomorrow üóìÔ∏è

* Begin migrating the existing JavaScript files (like routes and controllers) to **TypeScript**.
* Start implementing the API endpoints (CRUD operations) for the new `User` schema.
* Set up a testing framework like **Jest** with **ts-jest** to enable unit testing for the new TypeScript code.
