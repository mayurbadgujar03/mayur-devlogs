# Dev Log: Wednesday, August 6, 2025

## Summary

Today, I made a major breakthrough by architecting and implementing a new, advanced authentication system for the **Expenso** project. Moving beyond traditional passwords, I built a secure, passwordless "Magic Link" login flow. This new system incorporates a fintech-grade token rotation strategy to ensure robust security and session management, fundamentally upgrading the application's core.

## Key Activities & Accomplishments ‚ú®

### 1. Implemented Passwordless "Magic Link" Authentication

* Developed the end-to-end logic for a passwordless login system, which will significantly improve user experience and security.
* Created new `signupMagicLink` and `signinMagicLink` controllers to handle the generation, validation, and exchange of magic tokens.

### 2. Built a Secure Token Rotation System

* Architected a dual-token strategy using short-lived **Access Tokens** (12hr expiry) and long-lived **Refresh Tokens** (7d expiry), stored securely in HTTP-only cookies.
* Implemented **Token Rotation**: Each time a Refresh Token is used to get a new Access Token, it's invalidated and a new Refresh Token is issued. This prevents token reuse and enhances security against theft.
* Valid Refresh Tokens are stored in the database, linked to the user account, for stateful session management on the backend.

### 3. Developed a Secure Logout

* The `logoutUser` function now securely clears the relevant HTTP-only cookies and invalidates the session in the database, ensuring a clean and secure exit for the user.

## Plan for Tomorrow (Thursday, August 7th) üóìÔ∏è

* **Address the TODO:** Finalize the dashboard access logic to correctly differentiate between the initial magic link token and the standard access token.
* **Integrate Email Service:** Select and integrate an email service provider (e.g., Resend, Nodemailer) to handle the actual sending of magic links to user inboxes.
* **Begin Testing:** Start writing unit and integration tests for the new authentication controllers to ensure they are robust and error-free.
