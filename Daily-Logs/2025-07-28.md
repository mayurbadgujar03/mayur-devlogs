# Dev Log: Monday, July 28, 2025

## Summary

Today, I dedicated 4 hours to planning the next major version of the **Expenso** application. The focus was on architecting a more robust backend using **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma**. I also kicked off a new practice project, **MaxTeam**, setting up the foundational backend infrastructure and defining core database schemas.
