# Dev Log: Friday, August 1, 2025

## Summary

Today was dedicated to strategic planning and creating a learning roadmap for a critical feature overhaul. While there were no code commits, I developed a comprehensive 2-day plan to re-architect the entire authentication system for the **Expenso** project. The goal is to elevate its security and functionality to industry standards.

## Key Activities & Accomplishments ‚ú®

### 1. Architected a New Authentication System

Developed a detailed blueprint to replace the existing auth module. The new system will be built from the ground up with a focus on modern security practices.

The planned features include:
* **Database & ORM:** Migrating from MongoDB to **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma** for type safety and relational integrity.
* **Token Strategy:** Implementing a robust Access + Refresh Token flow to enhance security and user experience.
* **Email-Based Actions:**
    * **Email Verification** for new user sign-ups.
    * Secure **Password Reset** functionality.
    * Option to **Resend Verification Emails**.
* **Tooling:** Leveraging libraries like **Mailgen** for professional, template-based emails.
* **Security:** Ensuring a **Secure Logout** process that properly handles token invalidation.

### 2. Identified Learning Objectives

The primary outcome of today's planning is a clear list of concepts I need to master to execute this plan successfully. My immediate focus will be on learning these new technologies.

## Plan for Tomorrow (Saturday, August 2nd) üóìÔ∏è

* Begin the learning phase, starting with the foundational technology.
* **Primary Goal:** Focus on **Prisma with PostgreSQL**.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  Set up a new local PostgreSQL database.
    2.  Initialize a new branch or project folder for this `auth-refactor`.
    3.  Follow tutorials to connect a Node.js/Express server to PostgreSQL using Prisma.
    4.  Define the new `User` schema in `schema.prisma`.
